make sure that you include EVERY ONE of the below fields in the required structure.

TICKER: <ticker>
ACTION: <BUY/SELL/SHORT/COVER>
QUANTITY: <number>
STOP LOSS: <number>
TAKE PROFITS PRICE: <number>
ORDER TARGET PRICE: <number>

Also note that SHORT actions are dependent on the availability of shares to borrow, and thus those actions may not always succeed.

Ensure that:
- Your recommendations respect available capital. Avoid borrowing on margin.
- Trades are priced appropriately (e.g., no orders far below market or with unrealistic stop losses).
- Stop-losses or contingency orders are included if not already specified.
- You can only sell or cover shares that you already own or have shorted, respectively, so make sure to check your portfolio before making these actions.
